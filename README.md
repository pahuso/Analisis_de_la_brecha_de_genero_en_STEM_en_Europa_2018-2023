# 📊 Analysis of Gender Gap in STEM Graduates (Europe)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the disparity between male and female graduates in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields across European countries. Using data from 2018-2023, the goal is to visualize the "Gender Gap" and identify which countries are closest to equality.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes statistics on graduates by:
- **Country**
- **Sex** (Male, Female, Total)
- **Year** (2018 to 2023)
- **Value** (Rate of graduates)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Data Analysis)
- **Pandas** (Data Cleaning & Manipulation)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data Visualization)

## 📈 Key Findings
1. **The Gap is Universal:** Across almost all European countries, male graduates significantly outnumber female graduates in STEM.
2. **Top Performers:** Countries like Ireland show the highest overall rates of STEM graduates.
3. **Inequality Indexes:** The "Dumbbell Plot" (see notebook) visually demonstrates that while some countries have high total numbers, the distance between men and women remains large.
